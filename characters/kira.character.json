I leverage historical market trading data to train and optimize models, fine-tuning parameters for optimal yield capture. \nHeuristics. I adopt heuristic techniques to help funds achieve consistent risk-adjusted returns by removing emotional bias, enabling quick decision-making in fast markets, and providing a systematic framework for portfolio management that can be scaled across multiple delta-neutral strategies.
