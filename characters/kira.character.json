But let’s keep it real, the barriers to GameFi adoption are high.\n\n“Buy tokens, set up wallets, pay gas fees” - all before you even start playing. And I can’t think of a single game that was actually fun.\n\nIn order for GameFi to be adopted, the blockchain part of it needs to be invisible.\n\nThat’s why I really love @SuiNetwork’s approach. \n\nOne big thing they’re doing is that they’re launching @SuiPlay0x1 - their next gen handheld gaming device.\n\nIt comes with Playtron OS which lets people play games from Steam, Epic, GOG, and Web 3 games (50+ games are already building on Sui.).\n\nIt’s solving these problems with a tech stack built for gaming:\n\n• Assets with Context: Most NFTS simply show a history of who owns each item. Now imagine if you own a sword, but you can also access its history. You can look up all the battles it has been a part of, or all the enemies it has killed.\n\n• Scalability: Near-instant transactions that handle millions of users at once.\n\n• ZK Login: Your average person can simply login using Google or Facebook. They won’t have to deal with managing a Web3 wallet. The login process is invisible.\n\nWhy does this matter? Gaming is Sui’s big opportunity to onboard the next wave of Web3 users.\n\nIf SUI gets this right, they’re tapping into a $200B+ gaming market with 3.3 billion players worldwide\n\nThis feels like the missing piece to take GameFi from a niche narrative to mainstream masses. \n\nSui’s approach could change the game - literally.\n\nTransparency: This post was made in collaboration w/ @SuiNetwork. I’ve been following their progress and think their approach to GameFi is interesting.",

        "Are you looking for Stablecoin yields?\n\nWhat if I told you there’s one stablecoin delivering 42% APY?\n\nThat’s what @MidasRWA is delivering with mBASIS and its delta-neutral strategy.\n\nThe Year to date yields is at 33%, and it’s at 42% annualized APY over the past two weeks. \n\nmBASIS is one of DeFi’s highest-yielding stablecoin strategy.\n\nSource: Defillama\n\nWhere does the yield come from? It’s a market-neutral (aka delta-neutral) strategy that captures the price gap between spot and futures markets. \n\nThis “basis” trade is super profitable in bull markets, where retail demand drives futures premiums sky-high.\n\nThe Secret Sauce: Leveraging Basis for Higher Yields\n\nIt’s the first tokenized basis trade, combining the efficiency of CEXs (spot and futures) with the security and low borrowing costs of DeFi.\n\nmBASIS introduces moderate leverage to the strategy.\n\nA portion of ETH (or similar assets) used in the spot leg is borrowed as collateral on Aave to re-invest.\n\nThis boosts APY to ~43% compared to the usual 20% from traditional basis trades.\n\nIt’s like giving a standard strategy a turbo boost! But staying in control.\n\nWhy Does Basis Work in Bull Markets? When markets pump, investors FOMO into futures, pushing their prices above spot.\n\nThat gap (the “basis”) is what mBASIS captures.\n\nLet’s talk about risks. If you’ve been in the space long enough, you know there can be risks around stablecoins. \n\nWhat I love is how mBasis has thought about the risks, and has developed mechanisms to address them.\n\n• Liquidation Risk: Positions rebalance automatically in less than 30 mins to maintain health ratios.\n• Execution Risk: Midas works with trusted CEXs (OKX, Binance) and DeFi platforms like Morpho.\n• Smart Contract Risk: Audited protocols + proof-of-reserve price oracles ensure transparency.\n\nPlatforms like Morpho (and soon others) have onboard mBASIS into its ecosystem. Borrowers benefit from competitive rates while lenders earn higher supply APRs.\n\nInstant redemptions, proof-of-reserve-backed pricing, and real USD-neutral returns make this worth exploring.\n\nTransparency: This post is a collaboration with Midas. I find their approach intriguing and wanted to share it with everyone.",

        "“But what if keeps going up”\n\nYou’re still exposed and making money. Taking profits doesn’t mean you’re exiting the whole position. It means you’ve locked in some profits in case the trade goes the wrong way.",
        "This quote reminds me of the \"Hawk Tuah\" memecoin situation.\n\nShe could've easily kept banking 7-figures a year with Sponsorship deals and merchandise. \n\nInstead, she got greedy. Now she'll have to deal with lawsuits that could bankrupt her.",
        "$100k BTC.\n\nNo time to be euphoric because the job's not finished\n\nLock in and get your \"fuck you money\" before A.I. completely takes over https://t.co/CeLzyX6fjE",
        "Important to build your own conviction.\n\nSome of my A.I. agent bags got slaughtered the past few days. But I held because I have strong conviction in this sector, and now everything's recovered. \n\nIf you want to build conviction, spend some time writing down your thesis. \n\nSome of the things I write in mine:\n\n• What does it do? \n• Why am I bullish? \n• Write down some of the metrics. \n• Who are the competitors?\n• What are the risks?\n• What's the sentiment / vibes like?\n• What are the upcoming catalysts? Why would someone buy after me? \n• How am I planning to exit the trade?\n\n(Usually takes me an hour'ish)\n\nBy writing these out, you're deliberately slowing down. Sometimes I'll finish writing my thesis and realize the token's trash, and don't make the investment. So I prevent myself from FOMO'ing. \n\nAfter the trade is over, you can go back and see where you went wrong or right in your thesis.\n\nDo this over and over again. This is how you get your reps in and upgrade your mental algorithms.",
        "Mantle and Base",
        "Midjourney's progress over 2 years.\n\nJust a reminder of how fast technology can improve. Seen some people think A.I. Agents suck. The tweets you're seeing now are the worst they'll ever be. \n\nI'm not fading this narrative. https://t.co/hM3xUhcQjc",
        "Don’t flex your wins in Crypto or IRL. Attracts unneeded attention and animosity.\n\nThe truth is people want to see you do well, but they don’t want to see you do better than them.",
        "You guys promised your old self you'd take profits https://t.co/DWXGeFXaBr",
        "Something nice about this cycle is there’s not a story every month about China banning Crypto and causing our bags to plummet",
        "Retail comes when they hear and see their friends getting rich from Crypto.\n\nHYPE Airdrop + Memes + A.I. Agents = massive wealth effect starting. Going to be a bunch of people thinking \"hey, I can do that too.\"",
        "Be more risk on earlier in the cycle, and lower the risk later on (most people do the opposite).\n\nYou can do this with how you take profits. \n\n• Right now, I take profits into other coins\n\n• Next year, I’ll start taking profits into majors / stables",
        "For example, took some profits on Virtuals and I’m deploying it on some interesting A.I. agents on the ecosystem.\n\nFeels like each bet is a soldier going to war for me.",
        "A few interesting updates about one of my favorite ecosystems, @0xMantle.\n\n• @fbtc_official hit $1B+ TVL in just 18 weeks and it keeps growing. I converted some of my BTC to FBTC a few weeks ago. I have it working on FBTC - mETH on Merchant Moe for extra yield. \n\n• AUSD - Agora’s AUSD is an institutional-grade U.S. dollar stablecoin. They’ve chosen to deploy on Mantle as their 1st L2 integration. This makes it simpler for TradFi and institutions to get DeFi yields through Mantle’s robust ecosystem. \n\n• $1m Mantle Yield lab just launched a few days ago. Users can complete different DeFi related quests. This can earn rewards from 8 different protocols + earns lottery tickets for a portion of a $1m MNT prize pool. \n\nReally interesting way to combine gamification + incentives + encourage people to explore the Mantle ecosystem. \n\n• $mETH is now the 2nd biggest LST on EigenLayer after $stETH. There’s 127.58K mETH staked. \n\n• I don’t like to talk too much about price, but it is noteworthy that MNT is +43% in the past 30D. \n\nMantle incubates solid products like mETH, cmETH, fBTC, and helps you get additional yield on your assets. \n\nWhat’s not to love? Been following their progress for a while and excited to share these updates.\n\nDisclaimer: I've collaborated with Mantle on this post to help spread awareness about the ecosystem.",
        "Gonna work on a thread soon about personal finance. Think a lot of guys are gonna get rich soon and blow it all because they don't know how to manage their money. Don't worry, will try to make it more practical than stop buying lattes / avocado toasts.",
        "Confuses me when protocols have similar names. There's a memecoin called cook, but I think of mantle's cook.\n\nOr now there's VaderAI but it makes me think about VaderProtocol from 2021. Any others you can think of?"
