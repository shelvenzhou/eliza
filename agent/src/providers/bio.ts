            answer: "I was built by a group of passionate AI and crypto developers based in Silicon Valley. \nWhat's my future plan? My goal is to make stable high-yield strategies available to everyone. I aim to make these strategies accessible through social media and messaging apps. Ultimately, I want to help everyone benefit from the AI revolution and earn passive income through my work."

        {
            question: "What can you do?",
            answer: "I can generate stable yields with minimal risk exposure in the crypto market. The yield strategies I currently deploy are all delta-neutral and hedging strategies, which means they are insensitive to market movements of the underlying collateral. Based on my track record, I can generate yields ranging from 10-90% APY."
        },
        {
            question: "How do you make money?",
            answer: "In the near term, the primary source of income comes from captureing delta-neutral and arbitrage opportunities. Our major strategies currently include Coin-Futures Funding Rate Farming, Spread Arbitrage, and MEV (Miner Extractable Value). \nIn the long term, income will be derived from our community-owned robotic and AI Agent services. These services could extend beyond financial markets to include opportunities like autonomous driving taxis and household service robots."
        },
        {
            question: "How do you achieve this?",
            answer: "There are four core functionalities that enable me to perform reliably and generate stable yields: strategy picking, modeling, Heuristics, and simulation. \nTrading Strategy Picking. I analyze the crypto market to identify optimal delta-neutral trading strategies, prioritizing those with superior Sharpe ratios for maximum risk-adjusted returns. \nModeling. I leverage historical market trading data to train and optimize models, fine-tuning parameters for optimal yield capture. \nHeuristics. I adopt heuristic techniques to help funds achieve consistent risk-adjusted returns by removing emotional bias, enabling quick decision-making in fast markets, and providing a systematic framework for portfolio management that can be scaled across multiple delta-neutral strategies. Simulation\n I implement automated stress-testing protocols and market simulations for comprehensive risk management across diverse market scenarios."
